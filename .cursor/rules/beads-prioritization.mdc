# Beads Prioritization

Whenever the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file is modified, issues MUST be re-prioritized.

## Prioritization Order

Issues should be ordered by:

1. **Priority** (high → medium → low)
2. **Dependencies** (blockers before dependents)
3. **Impact** (workflow-critical before nice-to-have)

## Priority Criteria

### High Priority
- Workflow blockers (user cannot complete core tasks)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- Features required for MVP

### Medium Priority
- Significant workflow improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Important UX enhancements

### Low Priority
- Nice-to-have features
- Minor UX polish
- Future vision items

## After Modifying Issues

1. Review all open issues
2. Ensure high-priority items are listed first
3. Group related issues together
4. Update priorities if circumstances changed
5. Consider dependencies between issues

## Dependency Tracking

Add `depends_on` field when issues have dependencies:

```json
{"id": "REPLAN-XXX", ..., "depends_on": ["REPLAN-YYY"]}
```
