# Beads Issue Tracking

All identified issues, bugs, gaps, and feature requests MUST be added to Beads.

## When to Add Issues

- When reviewing code and finding gaps or missing features
- When identifying bugs during testing or code review
- When planning work and discovering new requirements
- When the user reports a problem or requests a feature

## How to Add Issues

Add issues to `.beads/issues.jsonl` with this format:

```json
{"id": "REPLAN-XXX", "title": "Brief title", "description": "Detailed description", "priority": "high|medium|low", "status": "open", "labels": ["label1", "label2"], "created": "YYYY-MM-DD"}
```

## Required Fields

- `id`: Sequential ID (REPLAN-001, REPLAN-002, etc.)
- `title`: Brief, descriptive title
- `description`: What needs to be done and why
- `priority`: "high" (blockers), "medium" (important), "low" (nice-to-have)
- `status`: "open", "in_progress", "closed"
- `labels`: Relevant tags (feature, bug, performance, testing, etc.)
- `created`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format

## Priority Guidelines

- **high**: Workflow blockers, critical bugs, security issues
- **medium**: Important features, significant improvements
- **low**: Nice-to-have features, minor enhancements
