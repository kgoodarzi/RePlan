# Context Refresh at 80%

When the conversation reaches ~80% of the context window:

1. **Summarize progress** in `docs/PROGRESS.md` (or the current progress file if different).
2. **Update the active plan** in `docs/PLAN.md` (or the current plan file if different).
3. **Sync Beads**: ensure `.beads/issues.jsonl` reflects current status and priorities.
4. Start a **new context window** and continue from the updated progress/plan and Beads.
